# Traffic-Sign-Detection-in-Rural-Areas
Abstract—Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) rely on accurate traffic sign recognition to ensure safe and efficient navigation. Despite advances in deep learning and computer vision, the effectiveness of current traffic sign recognition models remains highly dependent on the diversity and comprehensive- ness of training datasets. Existing traffic sign datasets, such as the LISA Traffic Sign Dataset, primarily include traffic signs commonly found in urban settings, leaving a gap in the
representation of signs prevalent in rural areas. This limita- tion challenges the deployment of AVs in rural environments, where unique traffic signs and varying road conditions require specialized recognition capabilities. This work addresses this limitation by augmenting the LISA Traffic Sign Dataset with traffic signs commonly encountered in rural environments, such as deer crossing, cattle crossing, and farm machinery signs. This process involves both real-world data collection and synthetic data generation to enhance the robustness of the model against diverse environmental conditions, including occlusions, weather variations, and faded signage. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating these rural-specific signs significantly improves detection performance in rural scenarios, providing a more comprehensive and robust dataset for future CAV applications.
